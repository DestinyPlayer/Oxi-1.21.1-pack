# The 1.21.1 iteration of the KPU Minecraft Modpack!

## How to install
Minecraft version: 1.21.1
Neoforge version: 21.1.138

Click the green `<> Code` button in the top right, then Download ZIP.

The `base-mods` folder is the baseline modpack of the server. The `mods` folder is my customized version of it.

Copy the contents from whichever one you want and then paste it in your mods folder.
