# The 1.21.1 iteration of the KPU Minecraft Modpack!

## How to install
Minecraft version: 1.21.1
Neoforge version: 21.1.138

* Click the green `<> Code` button in the top right, then `Download ZIP`.
* The `base-mods` folder is the baseline modpack of the server. The `mods` folder is my customized version of it.
